# -Predict-Whether-Using-neural_network-
This code implements a simple neural network with one layer to predict the likelihood of rain based on temperature and humidity using NumPy. The process consists of forward propagation to generate predictions and backpropagation to adjust weights and biases based on errors, all while training the model iteratively.
